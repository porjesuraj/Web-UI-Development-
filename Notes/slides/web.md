## Web architecture

### client

- machine which is having the browser installed
- the user who is using the browser for browsing the website
- e.g.
  - desktop
  - mobile

### browser

- a special application which is used to browse websites
- uses URL to browse a website
  - **URL**
    - stands for Uniform Resource Locator
    - resource: any file that is hosted (copied) on the server machine
    - e.g.
      - https://www.google.co.in/
      - http://192.168.0.2/
      - http://mywebsite:8080/
      - http://mywebsite:8080/myfile.html
      - http://mywebsite:8080/myfile.php?firstname=user1&address=pune
      - https://mywebsite#top

    - every url follows a pattern
    - components
      - **scheme**
        - the protocol that will be used while communication
        - e.g. http, https, file, ftp
        - optional, if missing then the default is http
      - **domain name or IP address**
        - the way to find the machine uniquely over the network
        - e.g.
          - google.com, apple.com
          - 172.217.166.46
        - mandatory
      - **port number**
        - port number of the web server running on the server machine
        - option, if missing by default
          - 80 for http
          - 443 for https
      - **path or file name**
        - file name of path of the resource
        - optional, if missing the startup/index page will be fetched
      - **query string**
        - used to pass input values to the website
        - it always starts with ?
        - it always will be present in key-value pairs collection format
        - e.g.
          - ?firstname=user1&address=pune
        - in the above query string
          - firstname and address are the keys

        - optional
      - **hash component**
        - is also known as proxy component
        - used for linking different sections of the page
        - optional
- creates HTTP request object
  - cotains the information needs to be sent to the server
  - has
    - header
      - key-value pairs
    - body
      - query string when the method is not GET

### server

- server is not a hardware rather server is a software
- types

      - WISA: Windows + IIS + SQL Server + ASP.net

- creates HTTP response

  - contains
    - header
      - collection of key-value pairs

- status code
  - used to represent the status of server's execution
  - types
    - **1xx**
      - repsents the debugging or informational messages
